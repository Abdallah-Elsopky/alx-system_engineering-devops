                Log File Processor
This project involves creating a shell script that processes a server log file. The script will:


1: Display the first and last 10 lines of the log file.

2: Count the total number of lines in the log file.

3: Extract and sort unique IP addresses from the log file.

4:  Find and count the number of occurrences of a specific error message in the log file.

5: Convert all text in the log file to uppercase and save the output to a new file.
